** Allegory of the Cave
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Compare the region which the eye reveals to the cave. Compare the light of the fire to the light of the sun. Compare the upward ascent to the contemplation of the upper world. Now you understand the mounting of the soul to the intellectual region. In the world of knowledge the Form of God is the limit for our inquiries and can barely be perceived. But, when perceived, we cannot but conclude that it is the source of all that is good and beautiful.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Now everything that becomes or is created must of necessity be created by some cause, for without a cause nothing can be created. The work of the creator, whenever he looks to the unchangeable and fashions the form and nature of his work after an unchangeable pattern, must necessarily be made fair and perfect, but when he looks to the created only and uses a created pattern, it is not fair of perfect.

** His Importance

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  ...he was so self-conscious about how philosophy should be conceived,
  and what its scope and ambitions properly are, and he so transformed
  the intellectual currents with which he grappled, that the subject of
  philosophy, as it is often conceived---a rigorous and systematic
  examination of ethical, political, metaphysical, and epistemological
  issues, armed with a distinctive method---can be called his invention.
  (Stanford Enc. of Philosophy)

** Structure of the Cosmos

-  circular
-  composed of bodies moving uniformly
-  with unspecified complex structures for irregularities

* Plato Summary

-  deductive and teleological approach to Truth
-  mathematics and a observation as /spiritual/ practices of
   /self-development/
-  denies *possibility* of truths about an imperfect natural world

* Remind me again about Aristotle?

-  384-322 BCE
-  Plato's student
-  Alexander's teacher

[[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Plato_and_Aristotle_in_The_School_of_Athens,_by_italian_Rafael.jpg]]

** His Importance

-  in medieval writings often just called “The Philosopher”
-  laid out a system of knowledge that persisted for thousands of years
-  helped lay foundations for theological & natural philosophic writings
   in /at least/ christian, Islamic, and Jewish traditions
-  combined an emphasis on /precise empirical observation/ with
   /rigorous deduction/

** Aristotle's Style and System

-  abandons dialogue
-  Builds a (largely!) self-consistent system across many fields of
   inquiry

* Aristotle's Natural Philosophy

four causes, Natures, and theory of motion at the heart of his physcial
theories

-  all natural phenomena must be explained in terms of these principles

** Four Causes

-  Material
-  Formal
-  Efficient
-  final

** Natures and Motion

-  /Nature/ of a being or substance explains its actions.

   -  nature of earth is to be at rest
   -  nature of fire is to move

-  When a body's's state of being not in accord with its *nature*, that
   is because some /efficient/ cause is /acting on/ that body

* The Heavens

-  Terrestrial bodies, with their tendency to rest or move
   “rectilearly”, also initiate in each other processes of change
-  Celestial bodies are unchangeable, and embedded in a fifth element,
   *Ether* or *Aether*

   -  move in a /circular/ fashion

** The Spheres

Aristotle gets this from Eudoxus:

-  Concentric spheres of aether rotate around the earth (center of
   Universe)
-  each has its own motion, but is also carried by the motion of the
   outer sphere

[[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~ebunn/homocentric/retrograde3.gif]]

** But Where does this motion come from?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [E]verything that is in motion is moved by something... the first
  principle that directly causes things that are in motion to be moved
  is that which moves itself, and the first principle of the whole
  series is the unmoved....

  So the necessity that there should be motion continuously requires
  that there should be a first movement that is unmoved even
  accidentally...
#+END_QUOTE

There must be an Unmoved Mover! As perhaps an efficient but *certainly*
a final cause

-  there may even be *Many* unmoved movers

** And how did it start?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  So the necessity that there should be motion continuously requires
  that there should be a first movement that is unmoved even
  accidentally, if... thre is to be in the world of things an unceasing
  and undying motion, and the world is to remain permanently
  self-contained... for if the first principle is permanent, the
  universe must also be permanent, if it is continuous with the first
  principle.
#+END_QUOTE

There can be no “first” motion!

(Because every motion or change requires a previous state of change)

* The divine

-  The “Unmoved Mover”, as cause of everything that is, is divine
-  however, this entity is not *within* the universe

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  It is clear then that there is neither place, nor void, nor time,
  outside the heaven. Hence whatever is there, is of such a nature as
  not to occupy any place, nor does time age it; nor is there any change
  in any of the things which lie beyond the outermost motion; they
  continue through their entire duration unalterable and unmodified,
  living the best and most self sufficient of lives... From [the
  fulfilment of the whole heaven] derive the being and life which other
  things, some more or less articulately but other feebly, enjoy.
#+END_QUOTE

-  in fact, in its perfection, the unmoved mover *has no awareness of
   the world* but *solely contemplates itself*

* Aristotle: Summary

-  Homocentric Celestial Spheres!
-  An Eternal Universe!
-  An Eternal, self-contemplating God!
-  a *De-sacralized* Nature!

* The Ptolemaic system

-  Ptolemy: CE 90-168; Greek-speaking Egyptian living in Alexandria
   under Roman rule
-  inherited idea of celestial spheres from
   Eudoxus/Aristotle/Hipparchus;
-  and stellar observation records potentially from ancient
   Mesopotamians

** The Physical Model

-  Homocentric spheres, severla for each planet, like those described by
   Aristotle
-  Much more carefully specified!

** The Mathematical Model

-  Uniform Circular motions, in “superposition”, to create complex
   motions
-  Techniques: epicycles and equants

   -  account for complexities of movements

** Persistence and Problematics

-  Incredibly resilient
-  Corrections make it increasingly heavy with adjustments
-  Copernicus will eventually find it simpler to move the sun to the
   center of the system (to eliminate equants)

* Sum-up

-  Two very different /methods/ to understanding the heavens
-  very divergent deductions about the nature of God
-  an enduring *physical* model of the cosmos
-  a monumental mathematics
-  a *heritage* to the monotheistic religions, and a set of *challenges*
